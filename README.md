# Clustering On Lipidomic Time Series For CD
As part of my research with Soha Hassoun at Tufts University, I utilized KMedoids() clustering algorithm with Euclidean distance to analyze changes in lipid profiles over time for patients with celiac disease. I developed this method for analyzing time series data which can be applied given a change in the distance metric to any time series dataset given. This project is ongoing.
